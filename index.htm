				<h2>What is it?</h2>
				<p>
					KeyCore is a lightweight system (weighing in at just 64 megabytes!) built with <a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/">Tiny Core Linux</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> for the purpose of testing keyboards. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It was originally designed for <a href="http://handygeek.co.uk/">HandyGeek</a> to test laptop keyboards being stripped for spare parts; a lot of which didn't have storage devices with an operating system.
				</p>

				<h2>Installing and booting from a USB pen drive</h2>
				<p>
					Start by downloading the latest version of the KeyCore ISO using the download link at the top of this page.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you have downloaded the ISO, you will need to find a USB pen drive with at least 64 megabytes of space and software capable of creating bootable USB drives. If you are using Windows, I highly recommend using <a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/">Rufus</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If using Rufus to create your bootable USB drive, simply choose the USB drive from the device dropdown list, select the ISO file you downloaded and then hit the start button; it's that simple!
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you have finished setting up your USB drive, simply plug it into a computer that supports USB booting, power up and within roughly 10-15 seconds you'll be in the KeyCore environment, which will display the key code of the key you last pressed.
				</p>

				<h2>Limitations</h2>
				<p>
					Currently, KeyCore is unable to detect modifier keys (CTRL, ALT, shift, caps lock etc.) being pressed individually. In order to test these keys, you must use them in conjunction with a key they will modify. For example, pressing ALT + A will give you a different key number than pressing A on its own, likewise pressing the A key whilst having caps lock enabled will send a different signal than if caps lock was disabled.
				</p>
